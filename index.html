  Starting from JATZ Mail version indev 0.3, a .py file is not available for<br>download.We are working

<h2>How to use JATZ Mail?</h2>
<p>
  JATZ Mail is a very user friendly program. As soon as you launch JATZ Mail, you will see
  five entry boxes. The top one is for extra features. To test it out type iamdev<br>into the
  top entry box. You will see a new section pop up. This is the "Dev Section" It has some extra
  features. New ones are coming out in indev 0.4<br>
</p>
<p>
  The other four entry boxes are for sending the email. The first one is for the message
  you want to send. The second one is for the email you want to send the<br>message to.
  The third entry box is for the password to the email you want to send the message from.
  This is required since you will not be able to log into your<br>email account without it.
  The last entry box is for the email you want to send from. This should be the same email
  to which you provided the password for.
